# Finger Counting using Hand Tracking Module

This project demonstrates finger counting using the Hand Tracking Module in Python. It captures video from a webcam, detects and tracks hands, and counts the number of raised fingers.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the required libraries installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Hand Tracking Module (`HandTrackingModule`)

You can install OpenCV using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## About the Code
The provided Python script fingerCountingProject.py captures video from the webcam, utilizes the HandTrackingModule to detect and track hands, and counts the number of raised fingers. It overlays images of fingers corresponding to the finger count.
